                <p>In 2012, Priceless Confections was created which began a journey that has now culminated
                  into Skyline Catering. Priceless Confections quickly became a local favorite with friends and families
                  from the local area. Shortly afterwards, she found that there was a need in the community
                  to help people with their social events. By 2015, Liz was regularly providing other foods and 
                  services along with her baked goods. This is when she enlisted Chef Jeff to provide fresh chef-inspired 
                  dishes with healthy choices and local favorites. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <p>In 2020, we created The Skyline Cafe which provided the local community with fantastic menus
                  of breakfast and lunch including daily specials with options for everyone's lifestyle. Chef Jeff 
                  created many favorite dishes that met the culinary needs of Smyrna with a focus on comfort foods,
                  fresh ingredients, and even met the needs for vegan, vegetarian, keto, and more! </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <p>The pandemic was a struggle and the cafe is no longer open. As all the local communities begin 
                  to recover from the last few years, our focus is to provide for the catering needs of all types 
                  of social events such as weddings, luncheons, family celebrations, and corporate events of the DelMarVa 
                  Penninsula. Our catering kitchen is in the Smyrna Health & Wellness Center in the heart of downtown Smyrna.  </p>

                <h2>Who we are...</h2>
                <p>In 2012, Liz Hansen began Priceless Confections as a way to give back to the 
                    Smyrna-Clayton community with wonderful cakes and cupcakes. In recent years
                    this was broadened into a full service catering team and then into a centralized 
                    cafe venue in the historic district of Smyrna Delaware.</p>
