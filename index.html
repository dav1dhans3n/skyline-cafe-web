                    <p>Yes, we did it. We put together a new restaurant called The Skyline Cafe which is specially
                        designed to provide fresh chef-inspired menus with healthy choices as well as some local 
                        favorites. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>We are planning to have breakfast and lunch menus with daily specials and we have options for 
                        everyone's lifestyle including dishes that are vegan, gluten-free, vegetarian, keto, 
                        whole 30, and more! </p>

                    <p>Look for your invitation for coffee when the cafe opens in early 2021 in the Smyrna Health 
                        & Wellness Center in the heart of downtown Smyrna. This location will include the bakery 
                        and catering lines from Priceless Confections too! </p>

                    <p>In 2012, Liz Hansen began Priceless Confections as a way to give back to the 
                        Smyrna-Clayton community with wonderful cakes and cupcakes. In recent years
                        this was broadend into a full service catering team and now we are expanding 
                        into a centralized venue in the historic distric of Smyrna Delaware.</p>
